# Basic80
 Basic interpreter compatible with 8 bit terminal computers.

 This project is being developed with learning purposes in clean room mode. I'm not examining other Basic interpreters ou original x80 Basic version. The objective here is to develop a fully compatible interpreter using only observation of classic Basics versions.

# Compiling
 
 1. Get the project files by using `git clone https://github.com/kortkamp/basic80`
 1. Go into project directory `cd basic80`
 1. Run `make` command and the code should compiler normally.


# Running 
	
1. You may run `make run` or, after compilation, run `./basic` .

1. Basic files can be load by using argument when calling the program like: `./basic mandelbrot.bas` .

1. Basic files can be loaded by using `LOAD` statement , but currently only uppercase named files in this form.

# Reporting bugs

 If you find some bug in the already implemented function and Basic commmands, please report.
